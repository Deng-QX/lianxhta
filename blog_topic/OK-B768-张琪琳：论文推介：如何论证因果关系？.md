> **Figure 4**: Proliferation of Empirical Methods Over Time in NBER and CEPR Working Papers   
> **Note**: This figure shows the proliferation of key empirical methods used in NBER and CEPR working papers over time: Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Instrumental Variables (IV), Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE), Structural Estimation, Event Studies, Simulations, and Theoretical/Non-Empirical research. Each panel represents the proportion of papers utilizing one of these methods per year, with the $y$-axis showing the proportion of total papers and the $x$-axis indicating the year of publication. The data covers all NBER and CEPR working papers from 1980 to 2023. DiD has seen a significant increase since the 1980s, rising from around $4 \%$ to over $15 \%$ of papers in recent years, reflecting its growing importance in empirical research. IV methods have also increased steadily from approximately $2 \%$ to over $6 \%$ over the same period. RCTs and RDDs, while starting from near zero in the 1980s, have grown to over $7 \%$ and $2 \%$ respectively in recent years, indicating the rising feasibility and acceptance of experimental and quasi-experimental designs in economics. Conversely, the use of theoretical and non-empirical research has declined significantly, from around $20 \%$ in 1980 to under $10 \%$ in 2023, suggesting a shift towards empirical analysis in the discipline. The use of simulations has decreased from over $6 \%$ in 1980 to around $2-4 \%$ in recent years. These trends highlight the increasing emphasis on credible identification strategies and the evolution of empirical methods in economics.

> Figure 5: Cross-Sectional Breakdown of Empirical Methods by Field in NBER and CEPR Working
Papers   
> Note: This figure displays the cross-sectional distribution of nine empirical methods-Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Instrumental Variables (IV), Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Event Studies, Simulations, Structural Estimation, Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE), and Theoretical/Non-Empirical research-across twelve fields in NBER and CEPR working papers. Each point represents the proportion of papers within a specific field that utilize a given method, with $95 \%$ confidence intervals depicted by error bars. The fields include Finance, Development, Labour, Public, Urban, Macroeconomics, Behavioral, Economic History, Econometrics, IO, Environmental, and Health. The plot highlights considerable variation in the adoption of empirical methods across fields. DiD is most commonly used in Health, Urban, and Labour, with over $21 \%$ of papers in Health, over $16 \%$ in Urban, and over $13 \%$ in Labour utilizing this method. RCTs are particularly prominent in Behavioral and Development, where they are used in over $20 \%$ and $11 \%$ of papers respectively, reflecting the feasibility of experimental interventions in these areas. Simulations and Structural methods are more prevalent in Macroeconomics and Econometrics, reflecting the need for complex theoretical modeling in these fields. Simulations account for over $6 \%$ of papers in Macroeconomics and over $6 \%$ in Econometrics. Structural methods are used in approximately 6\% of papers in Macroeconomics and over 5\% in Econometrics. Fields like Macroeconomics and Finance rely more on IV methods and simulations, with Macroeconomics having around 3\% of papers using IV methods and over $6 \%$ using simulations. Theoretical and non-empirical research remains significant in fields like Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics, with over $24 \%$ and $17 \%$ of papers respectively. These cross-sectional patterns reflect the methodological preferences specific to the research questions and data availability in each field, underscoring how different areas of economics adopt various empirical strategies to address their unique challenges.
